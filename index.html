				<p>While the Chaparrals had been modestly successful on the court, they were sinking financially by their third season, largely because the ownership group refused to spend much money on the team. After missing the playoffs for the first time in their existence in the 1972–73 season, nearly all of the owners wanted out.</p>

				<h3>THREE MOST VALUE PLAYER OF Tim Duncan </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>1999-2000 20 points 10 rebund 3 block per game  </li>
					<li>2002-2003 27.2 points 12 rebund 2.6 block per game  </li>
					<li>2003-2004 23 points 15 rebund 4 block per game </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Spurs qualified for the 1998 NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds[19] and replicating the performance in Game 2,[20] contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns.[5] However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference Champions Utah Jazz.[21] In this series.</p>
